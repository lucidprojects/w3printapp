W3Pack Version 3 PROJECT.

These are MS Visual Studio project files.

This version is rebuilt with .net v 4.5 and connects to secure servers using TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 exclusively

NOTE: This must be built on a system with .net 4.5 or above,
which means VisualStudio 2013 or above,
which means Windows 8.1 or above.

VMWARE INSRUCTIONS:
1) create a virtual machine for windows 8.1 (i downloaded a 90 day trial)
2) install .net 4.5
3) install visualstudio 2013 (i downloaded a 90 day trial)

BUILD instructions:
VisualStudio will produce a setup.exe file. 
Run that, and you will get an error about missing queries.xml in the temp build folder (is created, buried in the windows path). Copy from this main dir into that folder: FILE queries.xml, and FOLDER queries/, and any .sql file

Instantiate Software for client computers:
That temp build folder in the BUILD instructions is the complete package. Move that entire folder to desktop and rename it with your version or date.
Copy the file W3Pack3.exe to filenames per implementation (Like W3Pack_OXN_DEV.exe) and create/copy a matching ,config (like W3Pack_OXN_DEV.exe.config in w3pack_v3).
You can copy in the .config files and just match names to those. NOTE: we don't give OXN implementations to INI.
